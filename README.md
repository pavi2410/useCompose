## Installation

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file 

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```gradle
allprojects {
  repositories {
    ...
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```

Step 2. Add the dependency
```gradle
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.pavi2410.useCompose:<module_name>:<version>'
}
```

## Help Wanted
I want your help in making this library extensive such that this covers many of the commonly used hooks. Also, I want your help in building a KMP friendly library.
